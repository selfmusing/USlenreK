config KSU_THRONE_TRACKER_ALWAYS_THREADED
	bool "Always run throne tracker in a kthread"
	default y
	help
	  This option forces throne tracker to run in a kthread even on its first
	  run, which happens at boot time / decryption stage. This can decrease
	  boot time, but can cause crowning failure on some FDE/FBEv1 setups.
	  If you are having issues, say n.
